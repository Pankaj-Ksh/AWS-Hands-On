# 💻 AWS EC2 – Elastic Compute Cloud

## 🌟 What is AWS EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a core AWS service that provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud.  
It enables you to run applications, host websites, or perform large-scale computations without owning physical hardware.  
With EC2, you choose **instance types**, **operating systems**, **storage options**, and **network configurations** — all with pay-as-you-go pricing.
