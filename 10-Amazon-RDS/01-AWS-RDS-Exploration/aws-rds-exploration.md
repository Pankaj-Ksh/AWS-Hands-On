# 🚀 Exploring AWS RDS

This is a hands-on exploration of Amazon RDS, where I explored database creation, connectivity, security, monitoring, and read replicas.  
Learned how to connect RDS with pgAdmin and observe database operations and features.  
Gained insights into snapshots, replication, and Blue/Green deployment configurations in AWS RDS.
