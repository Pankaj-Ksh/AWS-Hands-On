# ☁️ AWS Hands-On Projects

Welcome to my **AWS Hands-On Portfolio**, comprising a structured collection of **service-specific labs and implementation-driven mini-projects** developed throughout my AWS upskilling journey.

Each project focuses on mastering a specific AWS service or solving a real-world use case, with **step-by-step execution**, **CLI/Console screenshots**, and **clear takeaways**.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Learn AWS by doing, strengthen core cloud skills, and build a portfolio of deployable and real-world use cases.
