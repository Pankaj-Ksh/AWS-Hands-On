# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Hands-On Projects

This repository includes a series of **mini projects and hands-on labs** completed during my AWS learning journey. Each module focuses on a specific AWS service or task, with practical steps, screenshots, and key takeaways.

The goal is to **learn AWS by doing**, improve my cloud skills, and build a portfolio of real-world examples.
